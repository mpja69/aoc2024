## Iterators
Playing arouund with _Iterators_.

The outer function is a "wrapper", (maybe can be called a "factory"). This wrapper function returns a function, a _closure_, which is an on is an _Iterator_.

We have a text file, where each line has a number. 
The iterator reads line by line with `fmt.Fscanln`, and for each line produces an `integer`.of the number.


So we do **not** have to 
- read the whole file into a `[]byte`
- split the data into lines with `strings.Split(...)` into another `[]string`
- loop over the lines and convert every line/string to an `int` and store it in a `[]int`
...and then finally loop over the integer slice to perform the actual task at hand.

Even if this example doesn't have so many lines of data to be read, and either way of solving it is just `O(n)`, (where `n` is the length of the file). It makes the code _clearer_! It becomes easier to tread and understand the _intention_ of the different parts.

### Example code
Pretty nifty. Takes a file name and scan each line into an `int`, on the fly, when you need it.


``` 
func readNumbers(s string) func(func(int) bool) {
	f, err := os.Open(s)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("readNumber(): ", err)
	}
	return func(yield func(int) bool) {
		defer f.Close()
		val := 0
		for _, err := fmt.Fscanln(f, &val); err != io.EOF; _, err = fmt.Fscanln(f, &val) {
			if err != nil {
				log.Fatal("readNumber(): ", err)
				return
			}
			if !yield(val) {
				return
			}
		}
	}

}

```

The solving the actual problem at hand, just use the Iterator in a loop:
```
for num := range readNumbers("myfile") { 
	... 
}
```

### Another way
The code inside the iterator could of course be used "on the fly" like this:

```
func main()
	f, err := os.Open("myFile")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer f.Close()

	val := 0
	for _, err := fmt.Fscanln(f, &val); err != io.EOF; _, err = fmt.Fscanln(f, &val) {
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal("readNumber(): ", err)
			return
			}
	
		// Do the actual task at hand with the value
		...
```
_But this makes to "overall code" unclear, since it's a mix of things solving completely different tasks!_ 

I'm not a "Clean Code" orthodox, but I like the _idea_ of "Single responsibilty Principle", and the Unix philosofy of "One tool one job".

I like to separate different tasks, with different intents, into different functions...which make sense to have this part as an Iterator.
(And of course the iterator approach would make even more sense if it were to be reused.)

At the same time I also like the idea of "Locoality of Code". <!-- TODO: Primagen? --> 

And I think of all these ideas as **LAIR**

## LAIR - Level of Abstraction, Intention and/or Responsibilty

_What problem are we trying to solve?_

Ask yourself that over and over, in different parts of the code.
And split/organize the code accordingly.

The goal is to get chunks of code that belongs together, and make sense to the "reader". (The "reader" is also yourself a week/month/year later.)

Aiming for clarity and simplicity.

>-It's **not** about writing as little as possible, (in each function).

## Process of trying/building stuff, high and low
Finding the ritght Level of Abstraction and organizing the code, is _hard to think out beforehand_!

The process of developing is **not**
