# Advent of Code 2024 in Go

## Kind of problems/solutions
1. Lists with numbers
2. Increasing/Decreasing rows
3. Find word int text. (Lexer or Regex)
4. Grid. Find pattern in 2D
5. Find correct rows in list 2, based on rules in list 2
6. Grid. Path seeking. Used "parser-inspiration" and generics and embedded structs.
7. Tricky. Recursion. Finding operators to match result.
8. Easy. Grid. 
9. Parsing lines.
10. Pathfinding. BFS.
11. Tricky. Recursion. 2nd very deep. Memoization. lenInt() and divideInt()
12. Grid w regions. BFS. Finding area + perimeter + sides 
13. Linear Equation System. Gauss elimination. Big mumbers. 
14. Easy. Robots moving speed+pos. Weird 2nd: looking for christmas tree 
15. Grid. BFS. BubbleTea for visualization.
16. Hard. Grid. Pathfinding. BFS. Dijkstra + backtracking
17. Simulate a machine. Bubbletea. DFS instead of recursion
18. BFS. Binary search. (Reader and Fscanf)
19. Dynamic programming (with Top-Down amd Bottom-Up). Patterns used: "canConstruct" and "countConstruct"
20. Grid. Used maps for representing this. BFS
