# Advent of Code 2024 in Go

## Kind of problems/solutions
1. Lists with numbers
2. Increasing/Decreasing rows
3. Find word int text. (Lexer or Regex)
4. Grid. Find pattern in 2D
5. Find correct rows in list 2, based on rules in list 2
6. Grid. Path seeking. Used "parser-inspiration" and generics and embedded structs.
7. Tricky. Recursion. Finding operators to match result.
8. Easy. Grid. 
9. Parsing lines.
10. Pathfinding. BFS.
11. Tricky. Recursion. 2nd very deep. Memoization.
12. Grid w regions. BFS. Finding area + perimeter + sides 
13. Linear Equation System. Gauss elimination. Big mumbers. 
14. Easy. Robots moving speed+pos. Weird 2nd: looking for christmas tree 
15. Grid. BFS. BubbleTea for visualization.
16. Hard. Grid. Pathfinding. BFS. Dijkstra + backtrackingg
